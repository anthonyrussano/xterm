# Web-Based Terminal Application

## Overview

This project is a web-based terminal application that enables interaction with a server-side terminal via a web browser. It leverages Node.js for the server-side logic, WebSocket for real-time bi-directional communication, and Xterm.js for the terminal interface in the browser.

## Features

- Real-time interaction with a terminal interface in the web browser.
- Server-side handling of terminal input.
- Echoes back user input with a simple echo command format.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js.

## Installation

To set up the Web Terminal, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repository-url]
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd web-terminal
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Running the Application
To run the Web Terminal, execute the following command in the project directory:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
Then, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see a terminal interface where you can type and receive echoes of your input.

Customizing
You can customize the terminal appearance and behavior by modifying the public/index.html and the server-side logic in server.js.
